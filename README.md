            <h3>AI in Cyber Today!</h3>
            <h4>AI, ChatGPT, Script Kiddie</h4>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a new age, versatile tool in not only the cyber community, but tons of others as well. 
               Having tools such as ChatGPT to help and create scripts for your daily life is great and all...but it comes with some concerns. 
               It makes tasks easier for non cyber professionals which inevitably opens the door for script kiddies. This will then increase your
               potential threats on your business and also your home. We are in an extremely important time to be verifying links within your email
               for malicious links. You never know what link can bring in unwanted guests to your home network! Enough of the negatives though,
               let's get on to the positives! Automation within your business practice is incredibly accessible now! Cyber professionals can use 
               tools such as ChatGPT and Bing's Chat AI to reduce time spent on projects which will potentially lead to lower costs! Keep your eye 
               on this newcomer AI!

            <h3>Is Human Error Cybersecurity's biggest threat?</h3>
            <h4>Phishing, Cyber Training</h4>
            <p>
                Ever been sent a suspicious email at work? I'm SURE you have. I'm also sure at least one person in your organization clicked the
                link in that suspicious email! Human lack of knowledge about cyber threats is a big hinderance on our security today. With gen z
                being one of the first generations to grow up with the internet, a lot of other generations haven't developed a keen eye to spot 
                suspicious links. Of course gen z is not perfect, we all have clicked something we shouldn't have... Why is clicking a link even
                dangerous in the first place? That link that you clicked could take you to a site like 'facehook.com' where you'll then enter your
                facebook credentials for someone else to keep! How do you avoid doing this? Awareness! It is very important to pay attention to 
                cyber security trainings at your workplace because they will warn you on a lot of this. Not only will it help you at work, but it 
                will also be applicable to your daily life. No one wants their amazon login stolen with all of your home address information, credit 
                cards, etc. Spreading awareness of the common threats we see daily will drasticly improve our chances of spotting a phishing email. 
                Be careful what you click on!
